### Service Communication

- **Authentication Flow**: JWT tokens issued by Auth service, validated by other services
- **Data Independence**: Each service manages its own database schema
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via REST APIs with standardized error responses

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.23+](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hannarijk/meal-prep.git
cd meal-prep

# Start with Docker (recommended)
make up

# Or start individual services for development
go run ./services/auth &
go run ./services/recipe-catalogue &
go run ./services/recommendations &

# Stop with Docker

# Option 1: Stop all services
make down

# Option 2: Stop all services and clean up containers and volumes
make clean
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check all services are healthy
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Auth Service
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Recipe Catalogue  
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # Recommendations

# Expected response: {"status": "healthy", "service": "service-name"}
```

## Recommendation Algorithms

### Time Decay Algorithm
Prioritizes recipes based on how long it's been since you last cooked them:

- **Recently cooked** (< 7 days): Low priority (0.1)
- **Good to revisit** (7-30 days): Medium priority (0.7)
- **Perfect time** (30-90 days): High priority (1.0)
- **Long time favorites** (90+ days): Highest priority (1.2)
- **Never cooked**: Medium priority (0.5)

### Hybrid Algorithm (Default)
Combines time decay and user preferences:
- **Time Decay Weight**: 60%
- **Preference Weight**: 40%
- **Final Score**: `(time_score × 0.6) + (preference_score × 0.4)`

### Preference Algorithm
Pure preference-based recommendations using your selected categories.

### Local Development

```bash
# Start dependencies only
docker compose up postgres -d

# Run services individually for development
go run ./services/auth
go run ./services/recipe-catalogue  
go run ./services/recommendations
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# CORS - only for local development (API Gateway will handle this in production)
ENABLE_CORS=true

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres123
DB_NAME=mealprep

# JWT Configuration  
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# Service Ports
AUTH_PORT=8001
RECIPE_CATALOGUE_PORT=8002
RECOMMENDATIONS_PORT=8003

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_FORMAT=json
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all services
make build

# Build specific service
go build -o bin/auth ./services/auth
go build -o bin/recipe-catalogue ./services/recipe-catalogue
go build -o bin/recommendations ./services/recommendations
```

## Testing

The project follows Go testing best practices with three test layers:

### Unit Tests (Business Logic)
```bash
# Run all unit tests
make test-unit

# Test specific service
go test ./services/auth/... -v

# With coverage
make test-coverage
```

### Integration Tests (Real Database)
```bash
# Run integration tests with testcontainers
make test-integration

# Skip integration tests (for CI speed)
go test ./... -short
```

### End-to-End Tests (Complete Workflows)
```bash
# Run full API workflow tests
make test-e2e

# Run all test types
make test-all
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report
make test-coverage
open coverage.html
```

## Deployment
```bash
# Production deployment
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Monitoring

### Structured Logging

All services output structured JSON logs suitable for log aggregation:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "info", 
  "message": "Request completed",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "request_id": "abc-123-def",
  "user_id": 42,
  "method": "POST",
  "uri": "/login",
  "status_code": 200,
  "duration_ms": 45
}
```

### Log Levels

- `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging
- `INFO`: General operational messages
- `WARN`: Warning conditions
- `ERROR`: Error conditions requiring attention

Set via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
```bash
  LOG_LEVEL=debug make up
```

```bash
# 1. Register new user
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"chef@example.com","password":"mycookingpassword"}')

# Extract token
TOKEN=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.token')

# 2. Browse available recipes
curl -s http://localhost:8002/recipes | jq '.[:3]'

# 3. Set food preferences
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8003/preferences \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"preferred_categories": [1, 3]}'

# 4. Get personalized recommendations  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8003/recommendations?limit=5" | jq

# 5. Log cooking activity
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/cooking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"recipe_id": 2, "rating": 5}'

# 6. Get updated recommendations (now considers cooking history)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8003/recommendations?algorithm=time_decay&limit=5" | jq
```

### Creating Custom Recipes

```bash
# Create breakfast recipe
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/recipes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Protein Pancakes",
    "description": "High-protein pancakes with oats and eggs",
    "category_id": 1
  }'
```

### Error Testing
```bash
# Test without authentication
curl http://localhost:8003/recommendations
````

```bash
# Test invalid algorithm
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8003/recommendations?algorithm=invalid"
````
Expected Result: Success (200) with hybrid recommendations:
```json
{
  "recipes": [...],
  "algorithm": "hybrid",
  "generated_at": "2025-08-28T...",
  "total_scored": 5
}
```
Why: The service has a validateAlgorithm() method that defaults to "hybrid" for invalid algorithms instead of throwing an error. This is actually good UX - graceful degradation.

```bash
# Test invalid recipe ID
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/cooking \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '{"recipe_id": 999, "rating": 5}'
```
Expected Result: Status 400 Bad Request:
```json
{
  "error": "recommendations_error",
  "code": 400,
  "message": "recipe not found"
}
```
